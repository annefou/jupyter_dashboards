# Storyline

Laura has just started her PhD program as part of the [Land-Atmosphere Interaction in Cold Environments](http://www.mn.uio.no/geo/english/research/groups/latice/) (LATICE) project at University of Oslo, Department of Geosciences, Norway. She is interested in exploring
field data from the [Finse Research Centre](http://finse.uio.no). [Finse Alpine Research Center](http://finse.uio.no) is located in the northwestern part of the Hardangervidda mountain plateau and is of great interest for scientists in particular biologists, geologists, geophysicists.


In addition to field data from Finse Research Centre, Laura wishes to use data from other Weather Stations available freely available from [the Norwegian Meteorological Institute](https://www.met.no/en). She would need to clearly identify in her plots the data sources (Meteorological Institute or Finse Research Stations).

<script src="https://embed.github.com/view/geojson/annefou/jupyter_dashboards/gh-pages/data/Hardangervidda.geojson"></script>

A large variety of data is therefore available to her and Laura would like to create the different plots to better understand her project and show what [Finse Research Centre](http://finse.uio.no) is about:

- Stream web camera from Finse railway station and show images taken from the Finse Research Centre
- Create a map to locate Weather Stations available from the Finse Alpine Research Centre and the Norwegian Meteorological Institute in the "Finse" region (Finse region at large)
-  Allow users to select the station (each station has a unique identifier), variable to plot (temperature, wind direction, wind speed, relative humidity, pressure, etc.) and period of time (start date and end date)
- Create an interactive table containing information about the Weather stations
- Show information on the battery of all Finse Research Stations because measurements are not reliable when the sensor battery is low. This will allow Laura to monitor the status of each stations (when the battery is down, she cannot receive data).

To complement this work Laura would like to use a snow and land surface model to run single-point simulations (for each station location). The model she will be using is called <a href="https://models.slf.ch/p/snowpack/">SNOWPACK</a> and is a multi-purpose snow and land-surface model.

<a href="https://models.slf.ch/p/snowpack/">SNOWPACK</a> has originally been developed to support avalanche warning (Lehning et al., 1999)[^fn1] and thus features a very detailed description of snow properties including weak layer characterization (Stoessel et al., 2009)[^fn2], phase changes and water transport in snow (Hirashima et al., 2010)[^fn3].

In terms of computational resources, this model is not too demanding and her work will consist in:
- Compiling and create snowpack executable: SNOWPACK is a written in C++ and the main program is call `snowpack`
- Prepare input files necessary to run SNOWPACK for various period of time using <a href="https://models.slf.ch/p/meteoio/">METEOIO</a>, a C++ library aiming at making data access easy and safe for numerical simulations in environmental sciences requiring general meteorological data
- Configure the model and run it for each weather locations

> ## Goal
> The main goal of this exercise is to write a blog/paper using Jupyter dashboards. Thanks to this approach Laura will
> have all the information she needs and would like to share in one single place:
>
> - the paper storyline including her bibliography
> - all the plots/visualization/video, etc.
> - the SNOWPACK and METEOIO library (compiled and ready to use)
> - the scientific workflows she used so that she or anyone interested in her work can easily reproduce her work (plots, simulation, etc.)
> - be able to generate various output formats depending where and how she would like to publish her work (for instance slides for conferences, HTML, LaTeX, etc.)

# Stream web camera / show static images

Laura can get live images from [Finse railway station](http://www.bt.no/tv/embed/?id=100521) and there is also a webcam on the roof of [Finse Research Centre](http://www.finse.uio.no/news/webcam/) (updated every hour between 6am and 6pm). The main purpose of the camera is to make it possible for researchers to follow the snow melt-off in the spring.

Laura needs to:

- Display the last available image from [Finse Research Centre](http://www.finse.uio.no/news/webcam/)
- Livestream [Finse railway station](http://www.bt.no/tv/embed/?id=100521)

Since we are viewing our jupyter notebook in a web browser, we can also render HTML content directly in the notebook. In fact, you can return virtually anything:

- image
- audio
- video


First create a new jupyter dashboard and rename it `dashboard_finse.ipynb`.


~~~
from IPython.display import HTML

HTML('<iframe width="560"  height="315" src="http://www.finse.uio.no/news/webcam/finsebilder/2018-01-26_12-00.jpg"></iframe>')
~~~
{: .language-python}

<figure>
 <a href="http://www.finse.uio.no/news/webcam/finsebilder/2018-01-26_12-00.jpg">

</figure>


A string is passed within `HTML` and you need to use `HTML` (Hyper Text Markup Language) syntax.  HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages and an in-depth description of this language is out of scope now.

And here we use iframe HTML tag. An iframe is used to display a web page within a web page and this is what we
do here as we display the entire webpage [http://www.finse.uio.no/news/webcam/dagens.jpg](http://www.finse.uio.no/news/webcam/dagens.jpg).

We also added the size (width and height) of our webpage (size we want to have in our jupyter notebook).

For more information on how to include webpage in HTML using ifram tag, look [here](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_iframe.asp).

## Stream web camera

We apply the very same recipe to display the livestream camera from Finse Railway station:

~~~
from IPython.display import HTML
HTML('<iframe width="560"  height="315" src="http://www.bt.no/tv/embed/?id=100521" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>')
~~~
{: .language-python}

Here we display the entire webpage [http://www.bt.no/tv/embed/?id=100521](http://www.bt.no/tv/embed/?id=100521).

## Select camera with python interactive widget

Laura does not want to display both webcam images at the same time and would like users to be able to choose which one to display. Therefore we need to interact with our notebook and be able to choose between:

- Finse Research Centre webcams
- Finse Railway Station livestream

Let's use python interactive widgets.  To make use of Selection widgets, we need to import `ipywidgets` python package in our notebook.

~~~
import ipywidgets as widgets
~~~
{: .language-python}

> ## Use your sticky note
>  Use a **green sticky note** to signal that you have successfully installed this package
> or the **red sticky note** if you encountered any problems.
{: .callout}

Now let's try different Selection widgets:

~~~
select = widgets.Select(
    options=['Finse Railway Station', 'Finse Research Centre'],
    value='Finse Research Centre',
    rows=2,
    description='Webcam:',
    disabled=False
)

display(select)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
radio = widgets.RadioButtons(
    options=['Finse Railway Station', 'Finse Research Centre'],
    value='Finse Research Centre',
    description='Webcam:',
    disabled=False
)

display(radio)
~~~
{: .language-python}

> ## How to display several widgets in the same cell
>  We used `display` to show our widget. You can pass more than one widget to display all of them in the same cell:
> ~~~
> select = widgets.Select(
>    options=['Finse Railway Station', 'Finse Research Centre'],
>    value='Finse Research Centre',
>    rows=2,
>    description='Webcam:',
>    disabled=False
> )
>
> radio = widgets.RadioButtons(
>    options=['Finse Railway Station', 'Finse Research Centre'],
>    value='Finse Research Centre',
>    description='Webcam:',
>    disabled=False
> )
>
> display(select, radio)
> ~~~
> {: .language-python}
{: .callout}

Many more types of "[Selection widgets](http://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Widget%20List.html#Select)" can be used. Have a look at the [documentation](http://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Widget%20List.html#Select) to get more information.

Laura is quite happy with Radiobuttons. Now we need to display the proper webcam when a user select Finse Railway station or Finse Research Centre. The easiest way to do it is to define another widget to display HTML and to link the radiobutton widget with the HTML widget.

Let's first see how to define an HTML widget:

~~~
webcam = widgets.HTML(
    value='<iframe width="560"  height="315" src="http://www.finse.uio.no/news/webcam/finsebilder/2018-01-26_12-00.jpg"></iframe>',
    description='Finse Research Centre', style = {'description_width': 'initial'}
)

display(webcam)
~~~
{: .language-python}

In `value`, you need to pass HTML code, same as we did before.

<figure>
 <a href="http://www.finse.uio.no/news/webcam/dagens.jpg">
	<img src="http://www.finse.uio.no/news/webcam/finsebilder/2018-01-26_12-00.jpg" width="50%"></a>
</figure>

To handle changes, widgets have a method (function) called `observe` which can be used to register a callback function.

 A callback function is a function which is:
- passed as an argument to another function, and,
- is invoked after some kind of event.

 Remember our widget `button`. When calling its method `observe`, we would like to call another function `handle_button_change`. This function will modify the value of our second widget `webcam` depending on the value of the widget button:

~~~
button = widgets.RadioButtons(
    options=['Finse Railway Station', 'Finse Research Centre'],
    value='Finse Research Centre',
    description='Webcam:',
    disabled=False
)

webcam = widgets.HTML(
    value='<iframe width="560"  height="315" src="http://www.finse.uio.no/news/webcam/dagens.jpg"></iframe>',
)

def handle_button_change(change):
    if change['new'] == 'Finse Research Centre':
        webcam.value = '<iframe width="560"  height="315" src="http://www.finse.uio.no/news/webcam/dagens.jpg"></iframe>'
    else:
        webcam.value = '<iframe id="iframe" width="560"  height="315" src="http://www.bt.no/tv/embed/?id=100521" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>'

button.observe(handle_button_change, names='value')

display(webcam, button)
~~~
{: .language-python}

The name of the callback `handle_button_change` is arbitrary and can be changed but the same name needs to be passed to `observe` method of `button` widget.

## From jupyter notebook to jupyter dashboard

Let's first add a title to our jupyter notebook. There are different ways to do; for instance:
- change the cell type to Markdown
- Create HTML text

> ## Add a title
>
> - Create a new cell above our widgets cell
> - Change its type to Mardown
> - Add a title `Finse Data monitoring Dashboard`
>
{: .challenge}

Let's do it by display HTML:

~~~
from IPython.display import HTML
HTML('<h1>Finse Data monitoring Dashboard</h1>')
~~~
{: .language-python}

Now go to the `dashboard View` and click on `dashboard Authoring View` as shown on the figure below:

<img src="../images/dashboard_authoring_view.png" style="width: 650px;"/>

Move your cells to get your title at the top and in the middle and display webcams below. Save your dashboard and close it (`Close and Halt`). Reopen it and check your dashboard layout has been restored properly (you need to execute each cell and then select `dashboard view`).

When selecting `dashboard view` the code "disappears" and you should see the cell outputs only. You also have a button at the top right `Show code on hover` which you can activate or not to show the code.

At the bottom of your dashboard, you should see `Hidden Cells`. We are not using them rigth now but the idea is to have the possibility to hide the output of some cells; for instance, cells we can use to compute intermediate results but are not useful to be displayed.

<img src="../images/dashboard_webcams.png" style="width: 750px;"/>

Use your **green** sticky note when ready or **red** sticky note if you have any problems.


# Create an interactive map for plotting geospatial data

## Requirements

We need to use the following python packages:

~~~
import folium
~~~
{: .language-python}

## Display Finse Research Centre stations

The locations as well as other metadata (sensor name, sensor identifier, description, etc.) of all Finse Research Centre stations are stored in [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/annefou/jupyter_dashboards/gh-pages/data/Hardangervidda.geojson](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/annefou/jupyter_dashboards/gh-pages/data/Hardangervidda.geojson) in [geojson format](http://geojson.org/). A full description of GEOJSON is out of scope now but let's have a look at the content of our file:

~~~

How to make the same plot as we have at the beginning of the lesson?

<script src="https://embed.github.com/view/geojson/annefou/jupyter_dashboards/gh-pages/data/Hardangervidda.geojson"></script>

To create a geographical map, simply pass your starting coordinates to Folium:

~~~
map = folium.Map(location=[60.6, 7.5], zoom_start=11, tiles='Stamen Terrain')

~~~
{: .language-python}

The first argument of the location is the latitude (in degrees and between -90 to 90) and the second argument is the longitude (in degrees and between -180 and 180). We centered our map around the Finse area.

To display the map in your jupyter notebook:

~~~
map
~~~
{: .language-python}


Now we need to add our GEOjson file `https://embed.github.com/view/geojson/annefou/jupyter_dashboards/gh-pages/data/Hardangervidda.geojson`.

You can pass a GEOJSON file to `folium` but we first need to download it locally from <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/annefou/jupyter_dashboards/gh-pages/data/Hardangervidda.geojson">here</a>:


~~~
import urllib.request

url='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/annefou/jupyter_dashboards/gh-pages/data/Hardangervidda.geojson'
# Download the file from `url`, save it in a temporary directory and get the
# path to it (e.g. '/tmp/tmpb48zma.txt') in the `file_name` variable:
geojson_filename, headers = urllib.request.urlretrieve(url)
print(geojson_filename)
~~~
{: .language-python}

We used `urllib` python package and store `Hardangervidda.geojson` to a temporary file; the filename of this temporary file is saved in a variable we called `geojson_filename`.

We are now ready to read our GEOJSON file with folium and plot it:

~~~
geojson = folium.GeoJson(
    geojson_filename,
    name='geojson'
).add_to(map)

map
~~~
{: .language-python}


<iframe width="600" height="400" src="../files/simple_map_finse.html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


# Create an interactive table (qgrid)
First we have to install the package qgrid in the anaconda-navigator. 
conda install -c tim_shawver qgrid
# the following step is required for windows users only. linux and osx users can skip it.
jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix qgrid

If you haven't enabled the ipywidgets nbextension yet, you'll need to also run this command:

jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix widgetsnbextension

Let's use the same json object (called `geojson`) we just read from our GEOJSON file.
~~~
from pandas.io.json import json_normalize

features = geojson.data['features']
json_normalize(features)
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
import qgrid
qgrid_widget= qgrid.show_grid(data_frame=json_normalize(features),
                show_toolbar=True)
qgrid_widget
~~~
{: .language-python}
In order to get the changed dataframe:
~~~
qgrid_widget.get_changed_df()
~~~
{: .language-python}

# Customize your interactive maps

We added all the station locations on our interactive map but it would be nice to add labels (using available information such as name of the sensor, description, etc.):

~~~
features = geojson.data['features']
for i in range(0,len(features)):   
    # Add information at the station location when you click on it
    location=[features[i]['geometry']['coordinates'][1],features[i]['geometry']['coordinates'][0]]
    name = features[i]['properties']['name']
    opr = features[i]['properties']['waspmote_id']
    description = features[i]['properties']['description']
    country = features[i]['properties']['country.etc']
    html = """

      <h4>country.etc: """ + country + """</h4>

# Create interactive timeseries (2D-plot)

Laura wish to plot timeseries for different variables (such as temperature, wind speed) for a given Weather Station.

Let's for instance retrieve `sonic temperature` (by convention sensor=`ds2_temp`) from `Hills` ('Sensor-5') from the 1st of December 2017 to the 1st of January 2018. We first create a request to remotely access data for download:

~~~
sensor = 'ds2_temp'

# Finse station 'Hills'
station = 'Hills'
waspmote_id='023D67057C105474'
waspmote_id='667767057C10548E'
station_id = int(waspmote_id,16)
start_date='2017-12-01T00:00:00+00:00'
end_date='2018-01-01T00:00:00+00:00'
params  = {
            'limit': 100000,
            'offset': 0,
            'mote': station_id,
            'xbee': None,
            'sensor': sensor,
            'tst__gte': start_date,
            'tst__lte': end_date,
            }
params
~~~
{: .language-python}

Then we request data and plot:

~~~
import plotly.offline as py
import plotly.graph_objs as go

# To initialize plotly for notebook usage
py.init_notebook_mode()

r = requests.get(URL, headers=headers, params = params)
if r.status_code == 200:
    if r.json()['count'] > 0:
        data = r.json()['results']
        FinseStations = json_normalize(data)
        # Add a new column where we convert 'epoch' (s) to a datetime
        FinseStations['timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(FinseStations.epoch, unit='s')
        data_to_plot = [go.Scatter(x=FinseStations.timestamp, y=FinseStations.value)]
        py.iplot(data_to_plot)
~~~
{: .lanuguage-python}

To add a legend, title to your plot:

~~~
# To add a title, etc.
layout = go.Layout(
    title='Sonic Temperature from Finse Station '+station,
    xaxis=dict(
        title='Date',
        titlefont=dict(
            size=18,
            color='#7f7f7f'
        )
    ),
    yaxis=dict(
        title='Sonic temperature (degrees Celcius)',
        titlefont=dict(
            size=18,
            color='#7f7f7f'
        )
    )
)
fig = go.Figure(data=data_to_plot, layout=layout)
py.iplot(fig)

# Arrange your plots in your jupyter dashboard

> ## Choose what to display and how
>
> Go to the `dashboard view` and arrange your cells to get your final dashboard:
> - You may add more widgets (`radiobuttons`, etc.)
> - You may hide/show cells
> - You may add text cells (HTML or markdown)
>
> If you need any help, use your red sticky note and once you are satisfied, put your green sticky note.

Finally don't forget to save your jupyter dashboard (`dashboard_finse.ipynb`).
